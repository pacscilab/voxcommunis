This repository will soon contain the code for generating files in the VoxCommunis Corpus, hosted at https://osf.io/t957v/ (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/T957V). In particular, it will contain the code necessary for developing:

+ pronunciation lexicons
+ speaker IDs
+ acoustic models
+ aligned TextGrids
+ vowel formant measurements
+ segment duration measurements
+ vowel f0 measurements

It also contains the code and data used in the original paper on the VoxCommunis Corpus in voxcommunis-lrec-2022/. This paper can be found at https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.566/ and cited as:
